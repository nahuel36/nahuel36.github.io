# Welcome!

I develop my own games... 
<br />Not the best look, but hey, Iâ€™m just a programmer!.
<br />You can check in [<custom_link>Itch.io</custom_link>](https://nahuel36.itch.io/)

### I'm experimenting with 
- **shaders** 
  - Shader Graph
  - HLSL
- **Unity tools like**
  - unit-testing
  - ui-toolkit
  - timeline window
  - node graphs 
- **and Assets like**
  - DoTween
  - some path-finders

# Working tittles

* **Light and Dark**
<br /> A top-down puzzle game

* [<custom_link>Artemito</custom_link>]({{ site.baseurl }}/artemito/)
<br /> A Point and Click engine, for Unity Asset Store

# Finished or paused projects

* **Focus**
<br /> Like pong but with a wall instead of an enemy, 
<br /> Adding graphic effects mostly with shaders, trying to distract you

* **Ninja Zen**
<br /> A tap, casual game
<br /> You have to destroy bottles with our ninja before it hits you

* **Monkey zero: Christmas special**
<br /> This is a demo of Monkey Zero project

# Games with companies

I developed games with other companies too, these have better look.
<br />In this companies I toke experience in console ports, like PS5, Xbox and Switch.
