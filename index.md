# Welcome!

I develop my own games... not the best look, but hey, Iâ€™m just a programmer!.
<br />I developed games with other companies too, these have better look, you can check it in my linked in page

# Working tittles

<br /> A top-down puzzle game

* **Artemito**
<br /> A Point and Click engine, for Unity Asset Store

# Finished or paused projects

* **Focus**
<br /> Like pong but a wall instead of an enemy, 
<br /> Adding graphic effects mostly with shaders, trying distract you
