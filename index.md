# Welcome!

I develop my own games... 
<br />Not the best look, but hey, Iâ€™m just a programmer!.
<br />You can check in [Itch.io](https://nahuel36.itch.io/)

### I'm experimenting with 
- **shaders** 
  - Shader Graph
  - HLSL
- Unity tools like
  - unit-testing
  - ui-toolkit
  - timeline window
  - node graphs 
- and Assets like
  - DoTween
  - some path-finders

I developed games with other companies too, these have better look.
<br />In this companies i take experience in console ports, like PS5, Xbox and Switch. 
<br />You can check it in my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nahuel-muchetti-066abb77/).
