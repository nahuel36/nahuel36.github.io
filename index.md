# Welcome!

I develop my own games... 
<br />Not the best look, but hey, Iâ€™m just a programmer!.
If you like some game and you can colaborate with Music, Art, Level Design or Story, [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)

### I'm experimenting with 
- **shaders** 
  - Shader Graph
  - HLSL
- **Unity tools like**
  - unit-testing
  - ui-toolkit
  - timeline window
  - node graphs 
- **and Assets like**
  - DoTween
  - some path-finders
