description: Point and Click Engine
---

**ARTemito** will be an **adventure graphic** or **point and click** genre Asset that will help you create your own game in **Unity**. 

(This is the english intro of Artemito, for a **Spanish** versi√≥n follow [this link](https://bitbucket.org/nahuel36/tdd/wiki/Intro%20Spanish))

There is still much work to be done. I want it to be **flexible** and **easy to use**. 


There are already some assets in the market but I want to do something different, a **fully customizable** engine, with tools like **Unit Testing** cases included and use of **design patterns**. 

It will be a cheap asset, in the dimension of what the engine is capable of doing.

In any case, I do not want it to have tools that Unity already facilitates, such as camera movements ([CineMachine](https://unity.com/es/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine) already does it very well by itself). It will also not have a language translation tool (localization), as Unity [Localization](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.localization@1.4/manual/index.html) package is sufficient. 

Also, I will provide **videos** explaining how to use the tools, and also how to use other free package tools.

I always recommend use git or any version control program.

The pages in this wiki doesn't have any utility yet, they are just reminders.
